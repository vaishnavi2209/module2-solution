					<b>Brown chocolate</b> comes from brown trees and white chocolate comes from white trees.Chocolate comes from cocoa beans which grow inside a large pod that grows on trees. To make chocolate the beans are removed from the pods and heaped into a pile. Sugar converts to glucose and fructose and which in turn start to ferment to alcohol and acetic acid. This then forms a variety of flavourful acetate esters and also kills the sprouts inside the seeds, releasing enzymes that break down proteins and sugars to tasty compounds.

					<b>Dark chocolate</b> (also known as black chocolate, plain chocolate, or sour chocolate) is a form of chocolate containing cocoa solids, cocoa butter, without the milk and sugar found in milk chocolate.Government and industry standards of what products may be labeled "dark chocolate" vary by country and market.Although dark chocolate has a reputation as a healthier alternative to other types of chocolate, such as milk chocolate,high-quality evidence for significant health benefits, such as on blood pressure, has not been shown.Dark chocolate has been around for over 3,000 years.It was developed around 1900 B.C in Central and South America as a drink. It was the only form of chocolate that was available at the time.

				<b>White chocolate</b> is a chocolate confection made from cocoa butter, sugar and milk solids. White chocolate does not contain cocoa solids, which are found in other types of chocolate.[1] It is characterized by a pale ivory color. The melting point of cocoa butter, the only cocoa bean component of white chocolate, is high enough to keep white chocolate solid at room temperature, as with milk chocolate and dark chocolate.White chocolate does not contain cocoa solids (the non-fat component of cocoa).Cocoa solids are the primary constituent of conventional chocolate liquor â€” chocolate in its raw, unsweetened form. During manufacturing, the dark-colored solids of the cocoa bean are separated from its fatty content, as with milk chocolate and dark chocolate.
